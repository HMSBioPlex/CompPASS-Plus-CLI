# CompPASS-Plus-CLI
R script implementation of CompPASS-Plus. This algorithm was developed for supervised filtering of large AP-MS datasets (i.e. thousands of individual IP's) to separate bona fide interacting proteins from non-specific background and false positive protein ID's. 

This algorithm was originally described in Huttlin et al. (2015) Cell, 162:425-440 and has been used to produce the BioPlex network of human protein interactions as described in that paper and in Huttlin et al. (2017) Nature, 545:505-509 as well as Huttlin et al. (2020) bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/2020.01.19.905109. For more information on the BioPlex project, see bioplex.hms.harvard.edu.
